# 20Q (Twenty Questions)

## 🎯 About the Project
**20Q (Twenty Questions)** is a fun and interactive game where users can submit and guess words, places, characters, or objects based on provided hints and categories. The application allows users to create challenges and explore different word-based puzzles, enhancing their critical thinking skills.

## 🚀 Why I Built This
I created **20Q** to:
- Provide an engaging and interactive guessing game.
- Allow users to contribute challenges with different categories.
- Implement and explore backend services with Firebase Firestore.
- Learn and practice serverless deployment using **Vercel**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
### **Frontend:**
- **React.js** – For the user interface.
- **React Router** – For navigation between pages.
- **Axios** – For making API requests.
- **Tailwind CSS** – For styling the UI.

### **Backend:**
- **Node.js & Express.js** – For handling API requests.
- **Firebase Firestore** – As a NoSQL database for storing challenges.
- **Vercel** – For serverless deployment.



## 🌍 Deployment
- The backend is **deployed on Vercel**.
- The frontend can be deployed on **Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting**.
- To redeploy the backend:
  ```sh
  vercel --prod
  ```
